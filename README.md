# BookStore
#API endpoints (CRUD)
localhost/books/ - Send a get request to fetch all books
localhost/books/:id - To fetch a book by its id

#Instructions to set up and run the application locally
1. Clone the repository into your local system from github.
2. Move to the terminal of your "backend" directory.
3. Run "npm run dev" and the backend shall be hosted in port 5555 although it might not work since the server is connected to my mongoDB atlas. In that case, replace given mongoURI with yours and it will work.
4. Next move to the terminal of "frontend" directory.
5. Again write "npm run dev" in the terminal and hit enter. The site will be live on port 5173.
6. You might change the ports as per your wish.

P.S - This is demo of a personal project and only the person with his own mongoDB server can perform CRUD operations.
